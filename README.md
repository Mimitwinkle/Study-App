# Youtube Compiler
This project was created by [Marjoriels](github.com/marjoriels) and Kelly Hills for the 2020 Cutie Hack hackathon.

# Inspiration
More and more people are using YouTube for their workouts. Many find workout videos to be a great way to break a sweat during the coronavirus pandemic. However, searching YouTube for your favorite workout video can be time consuming as well as disorganized.

# What it does
We set out to create a website that will keep your favorite videos in one place in a clear and simple manner.

# How we built it
We used different coding elements to make it all come together. JavaScript, HTML, and CSS are the languages we used to create a website where the user can add links for their preferred workouts in an organized manner.

# Challenges we ran into
We had some difficulty storing certain elements, such as creating variables that would store the links that the user uploads. In the end, we were not able to finish our project.

# Accomplishments that we're proud of
We didn't let the things we didn't know about coding intimidate us. There were many things we didn't know that we learned together to create the code that we have now.

# What we learned
We've become more familiar with collaborating on GitHub and it's features that allow us to branch out the code. Although we were both intimidated by hackathons at first, we both learned that they are not as scary as they seem!

# What's next for YouTube Workout Compiler
Eventually we would be able to compile other files or items that are not necessarily videos. A user would be able to upload sounds, images, and different types of files pertaining to their interests.
